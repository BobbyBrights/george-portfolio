        <h2>The problem</h2>
        <p>Kay Hendriks told us that the data acquired on machines during his training often get destroyed without getting used. Thats why he started keeping track off it in a logbook. Training on a topathlete level creates a schedule in which time is the most valuable thing. </p>
        <p>From his story two important guidelines appeared:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Create a simple workflow that saves Kay time when entering data.</li>
          <li>Create an overview of all his training/nutrion data so that he can use ito gain insight on his results.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>A challenge</h2>
        <p>The first challenge in the project were the number of teammembers. The team consisted out of 5 classmates from which only a few had experience with finishing a project from start till end. At that time I was aware, that the project would require me to take the initiative  from the very beginning to the very end and it would challenge us all to deliver the user and the business needs.</p>
        <p>The second challenge was to deliver a professional product on a tight deadline, while most of our team lacked the skillsets to follow professional guidelines. This meant that while creating a planning, we had to take in account that we needed to find alternative methods to fullfill customer needs and that our research would be based on any source that we could gather in order to deliver a great product.</p>

        <h2>A challenge</h2>
        <p>We tried to stay focused through the research fase, by making it short and effective. We gathered as much as possible from user feedbacks, logbooks, interviews etc. We also created a detailed competitor analysis that gave us insights of current apps and helped us meet the priorities to differentiate our product from all the others. The research phase continued with creating assumptions, that we later validated with surveys and user interviews. We started asking questions like “Who is Kay Hendriks”, “Which functions are usefull to him”, “Which goals do they have to achieve” and what are the user needs and desires.</p>

        <h2>Wireframes/User task flow</h2>
        <p>Task flows helped us to think through the design, before a feature was actually developed. It helped us placing the user into the flow off the app and determine wether the conceptual model agrees with the user model. Wireframes helped us to visuale this user task flow. We started with sketches and continued with high-fedelity mockups. Since we were going to use the mockups for user validation, we used as much real data as possible.</p>
